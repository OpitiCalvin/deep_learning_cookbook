In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards.

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]].

''Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice'' (2004). AK Press. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;\\xe2\\x80\\x94rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.

The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries.

Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press.

This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (&quot;a&quot;).&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical.

      "b\"From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama, like many states in the [[Southern United States|southern U.S.]], suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against African Americans from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s.  Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and [[African Americans]] were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008-2018 |work=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\"\n",

      "b\"Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]].

      "b\"Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\\n\"\n",

      "b'At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\\n'\n",

      "b'After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\\n'\n",

      "b'From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\\n'\n",

      "b\"Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\\n\"\n",

Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.

In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 honour, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honour Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles' oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient.

      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b'Born in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]], Lincoln grew up on the [[American frontier|western frontier]] in [[Kentucky]] and [[Indiana]]. Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in [[Illinois]], a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, and was elected to the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], in which he served for eight years. Elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy and opposed the [[Mexican\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War]]. After a single term, he returned to Illinois and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], which had a statewide majority in Illinois. As part of the 1858 campaign for US Senator from Illinois, Lincoln took part in a [[Lincoln\\xe2\\x80\\x93Douglas debates|series of highly publicized debates]] with his opponent and rival, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]]; Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of [[slavery]], but lost the race to Douglas. In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a [[swing state]], though most delegates originally favored other candidates. Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the [[Southern United States|South]], he swept the [[Northern United States|North]] and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]].\\n'\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b\"Though there were attempts to bridge the differences between North and South, ultimately Lincoln's victory prompted seven southern slave states to secede from the United States and form the [[Confederate States of America]] before he moved into the [[White House]]. U.S. troops refused to leave [[Fort Sumter]], a fort located in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], after the secession of the Southern States. The resulting Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to rally behind the Union. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; [[War Democrats]], who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political [[patronage]] and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), pp. 65\\xe2\\x80\\x9387.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Gettysburg Address]] became an iconic endorsement of [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', leading to the controversial ''[[Ex parte Merryman]]'' decision, and he averted potential [[United Kingdom|British]] intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of generals, including his most successful general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery.\\n\"\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b\"An astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. Anticipating the war's conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]], Lincoln was shot by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]] and died the next day.

Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, Chapter XXII. {{isbn|978-0671201586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching Alexander gave Aristotle many opportunities. He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books, which were [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to [[empiricism]].{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=16}} He believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on [[perception]]. Aristotle's views on [[natural science]]s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.\\n\"\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b\"Aristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle's [[zoology|zoological]] observations, such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]. [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\\xe2\\x80\\x931400)|Islamic thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as &quot;The First Teacher&quot;. His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]].\\n\"\n",

      "b\"All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of academic study. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}} Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including [[Raphael]] and [[Rembrandt]]. [[Early Modern]] theories including [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulation of the blood]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]'s [[kinematics]] were developed in reaction to Aristotle's. In the 19th century, [[George Boole]] gave Aristotle's logic a mathematical foundation with his system of [[Boolean algebra|algebraic logic]]. In the 20th century, [[Martin Heidegger]] created a new interpretation of Aristotle's political philosophy, but elsewhere Aristotle was widely criticised, even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] and the biologist [[Peter Medawar]]. More recently, Aristotle has again been taken seriously, such as in the thinking of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], while [[Armand Marie Leroi]] has reconstructed [[Aristotle's biology]]. The image of Aristotle tutoring the young Alexander remains current, as in the 2004 film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', and the ''Poetics'' continues to play a role in the [[cinema of the United States]].\\n\"\n",

      "b\"The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.&lt;ref name=SEPactupote/&gt;\\n\"\n",

Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity?

Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated.

In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.&lt;ref name=Shute1941/&gt; Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt; When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.&lt;ref name=Shute1941/&gt; However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt; So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.&lt;ref name=Modrak&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Modrak |first1=Deborah |title=Dreams and Method in Aristotle |journal=Skepsis: A Journal for Philosophy and Interdisciplinary Research |date=2009 |volume=20 |pages=169\\xe2\\x80\\x93181}}&lt;/ref&gt; During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt; This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt;\\n'\n",

If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt;\\n\"\n",

      "b\"Gershwin was attracted by [[Maurice Ravel]]'s unusual chords. Upon Gershwin's request, Ravel accepted him as a student, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study. After his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, Ravel said he couldn't teach him but he would send a letter referring him to [[Nadia Boulanger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spycket1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-VcUAeWQr0C&amp;pg=PA71|title=Nadia Boulanger|author=J\\xc3\\xa9r\\xc3\\xb4me Spycket|publisher=Pendragon Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-945193-38-8|pages=71\\xe2\\x80\\x9373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot; /&gt; While the studies were cut short, that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of An American in Paris written as a 'thank you note' to  Gershwin's hosts, Robert and Mabel Shirmer. Gershwin called it &quot;a rhapsodic ballet&quot;; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works.&lt;ref name=&quot;JablonskiStewart1958&quot; /&gt;\\n\"\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b\"Gershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to the United States for a tour.  To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel's friend [[E. Robert Schmitz|Robert Schmitz]], a pianist Ravel had met during the War, to urge Ravel to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica, promoting Franco-American musical relations, and was able to offer Ravel a $12,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel.  \\n\"\n",
      "b'  \\n'\n",
      "b\"Gershwin greeted Ravel in New York in February 1928 at the start of Ravel's U.S. Tour, and joined  Ravel again later in the tour in Los Angeles.  After a lunch together with [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] in Beverly Hills, Ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled 'house concert' in a friend's music salon, performing among kindred spirits.\\n\"\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b\"Ravel's tour reignited Gershwin's desire to return to Paris which he did in March 1928. Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris.  Yet after playing for her, she told him she could not teach him. Nadia Boulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students: &quot;Don't copy others; be yourself.&quot; In this case, &quot;Why try to be a second rate Ravel when you are already a first rate Gershwin?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jablonski, Edward (1987). Gershwin. Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-19431-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers, among them [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Ernest Hemingway]]; and artist [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;LSRI Archives Oral Interview Anita Loos and Mary Anita Loos October 1979 re: letters and Ravel's telegram to Gershwin&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\"\n",

He described the piece as a &quot;rhapsodic ballet&quot; because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works.

      "b\"Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''An American in Paris''. He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with &quot;a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.&quot; Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[C\\xc3\\xa9sar Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, &quot;It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot; /&gt;\\n\"\n",

It is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin's composition process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/ |title=New, critical edition of George and Ira Gershwin's works to be compiled &amp;#124; PBS NewsHour |website=Pbs.org |date=2013-09-14 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\"\n",

      "b\"''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for [[RCA Victor]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the [[RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra]], drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A flat, B flat, a higher C and a lower D.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;  The radio broadcast of the September&amp;nbsp;8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducting  the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the piece for [[RCA Victor]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The [[Seattle Symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bargreen |first=Melinda |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900628&amp;slug=1079541 |title=Entertainment &amp; the Arts &amp;#124; Recordings &amp;#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |website=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=1990-06-28 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Harry James]] released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album ''One Night Stand,'' recorded live at the [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom in Chicago]] ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]] GL 522 and CL 522). \\n\"\n",

At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films.

By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries.

      "b\"The ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]] to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into first Sunday of March in order to avoid clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.

The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale  13 September 1956, using an [[Atomichron]] commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the [[National Bureau of Standards]], [[Boulder, Colorado]].   Both the BIH scale and A.1 were defined by an [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958&lt;ref&gt;It was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant.&lt;/ref&gt; The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: &quot;A3&quot; in 1963 and &quot;TA(BIH)&quot; in 1969.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=199&amp;ndash;201}} This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.

Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks were, on average, well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.

      "b\"UTC is a [[discontinuous]] (i.e. regularly adjusted by leap seconds) time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time. From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971 the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated [[UT2]].  Afterwards these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate [[UT1]].  This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale; the post-1971 more linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally. The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=227&amp;ndash;229}}\\n\"\n",

      "b':Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt; Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic.

When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man.

      "b':People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;\\n'\n",

      "b':Explicit [[extrinsic]] rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;\\n'\n",

It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[David Sloan Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also [[in-group favoritism]]).

Damasio]] and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that When confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with &quot;end-justifies-the-means&quot; answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue - in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city - these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to [[Adrian Raine]], a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: &quot;Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse.

The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges [[Public sociology]] saying, &quot;The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable&quot; (&quot;Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity&quot; ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and &quot;build the good society&quot;. The motivation of altruism is also the focus of study; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Thulin EW, Bicchieri C.

Jainism preaches the view of ''[[Ahimsa]]'' \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhdev]], introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.\\n\"\n",

      "b\"Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment.\\n\"\n",

Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms.

From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love&quot;, as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests.&quot; In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception,'' Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.\\n\"\n",

      "b'==Early life==\\n'\n",
      "b\"Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, Dwan, was the younger son of commercial traveller of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857\\xe2\\x80\\x931917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan, ''n\\xc3\\xa9e'' Hunt. The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old, on 4 December 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883\\xe2\\x80\\x931964), became a physician. At the [[University of Notre Dame]], Allan Dwan studied engineering and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Brownlow 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Brownlow, Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Brownlow|title=The Parade's Gone By...|publisher=[[Ballantine Books|Ballantine Books, Inc.]]|location=New York|year=1969|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frankenstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Fournier|first=Pierre|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5706057/the-first-frankenstein-of-the-movies|title=The first Frankenstein of the movies|work=[[io9]]|date=4 December 2010|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\"\n",

On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]].\\n'\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b\"After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Dwan directed [[Gloria Swanson]] in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process [[Phonofilm]]. This short, also featuring [[Thomas Meighan]] and [[Henri de la Falaise]], was produced as a joke, for the 26 April 1925 &quot;Lambs' Gambol&quot; for [[The Lambs]], with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\\n\"\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b\"Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], Dwan directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi (1937 film)|Heidi]]'' (1937) and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938).\\n\"\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b\"Dwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/SearchResult.aspx?s=&amp;retailCheck=&amp;Type=PN&amp;CatID=DATABIN_DIRECTOR&amp;ID=11207&amp;AN_ID=&amp;searchedFor=Allan_Dwan_|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Allan Dwan, Filmography|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\"\n",

He owns the most important steel company in the United States, and invents Rearden Metal, an [[alloy]] stronger than steel (with similar properties to stainless steel). He lives in [[Philadelphia]] with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother. Rearden represents a type of [[self-made man]] or prototypical hero, and illustrates Rand's [[Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|theory of sex]] in so far as he accepts the traditional view of sexual congress as a subhuman instinct, but responds sexually to Dagny Taggart.\\n\"\n",

      "b\"Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and himself likewise. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. Willers does not possess the creative ability of Galt's associates, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.\\n\"\n",

      "b\"One of Galt's first followers, and world-famous as a [[pirate]], who seizes relief ships sent from the United States to the People's States of Europe. He works to  ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough capital to rebuild the world. Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskj\\xc3\\xb6ld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years. Danneskj\\xc3\\xb6ld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a retired [[film star]]. Considered a misfit by Galt's other adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt's perspective.\\n\"\n",

Retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskj\\xc3\\xb6ld's name was a tribute to Victor Hugo's novel, ''Hans of Iceland'', wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskj\\xc3\\xb6ld. In the published book, Danneskj\\xc3\\xb6ld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.\\n\"\n",

      "b\"The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.\\n\"\n",

Lillian achieves this, when she passes information to James Taggart about her husband's affair with his sister. This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others. Lillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual satisfaction, until Hank abandons her.\\n\"\n",

He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled ''Why Do You Think You Think?'' He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.\\n\"\n",

He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone). The character was, in part, modeled on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;David Harriman, ''[[Journals of Ayn Rand]]'', pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the &quot;man who knew better&quot; but chose not to act for the good.\\n\"\n",

In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources.

He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at the job. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental. He is based on [[Aristotle]].\\n\"\n",

Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny.

On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel.

He never earned money by force or fraud (except for bribing government officials and throwing an opponent down a flight of stairs), and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters, and draws a dollar sign on its base as a signal to Francisco when she is ready to join Galt's strike.  It is suspected that he is modeled after James Jerome Hill, builder of the Great Northern Railroad. \\n\"\n",

      "b\"*The '''Wet Nurse (Tony)''' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.\\n\"\n",

When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: &quot;I am leaving it as I found it. Take over.

The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions).

One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in China and its zone of cultural influence; [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centered on the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]], to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various [[Western religion]]s.

According to [[Clement of Alexandria]], he wrote what were called the &quot;forty-two books of Hermes&quot;, covering all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter IV.|Clement, ''Stromata'', vi. 4.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hermetica]]'' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners.

Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.\\n\"\n",

      "b\"Alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. Initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images, after being given a copy of the translation of ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'', a Chinese alchemical text, by his friend Richard Wilhelm, Jung discovered a direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner, symbolic images coming up in dreams, visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients. A process, which he called &quot;process of individuation&quot;. He regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this &quot;process of [[individuation]]&quot; of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C.

Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&quot;/&gt; Together with his alchemical ''mystica soror'', Jungian Swiss analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]], Jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available, compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross-references&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens: ''On Jung.'' (A new and authoritiative introduction to Jung's life and thought), Penguin Books, London 1990, {{ISBN|0140124942}}, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and pored over them. The volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the ''[[hieros gamos]]''  or divine marriage. His writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams, symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson.

In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate [[Conceptual model|model]]s of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die.

      "b\"Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a [[telescope]] through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, [[photographic plates]] were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers' time.\\n\"\n",

This was accommodated by removing &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; (underscore) from ''6'' and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with ''8'' and ''9''. This discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[Teletype Model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the [[IBM Selectric]] (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers{{snd}} following the [[IBM PC]] (1981), especially [[Model M]] (1984){{snd}} and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The &lt;code&gt;/?&lt;/code&gt; pair also dates to the No. 2, and the &lt;code&gt;,&amp;lt; .&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; (comma) or &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the &lt;code&gt;;:&lt;/code&gt; pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly &lt;code&gt;-* =+&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;:* ;+ -=&lt;/code&gt;.\\n\"\n",

      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b'Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as &quot;delete previous character&quot; was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.\\n'\n",

      "b'When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, &quot;transmit on&quot;) caused the tape reader to resume.  This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a &quot;handshaking&quot; signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.  The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and &lt;s&gt;TAPE&lt;/s&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;McConnell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding ASCII Codes |author-last1=McConnell |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Haynes |author-first2=James |author-last3=Warren |author-first3=Richard |url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |access-date=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n'\n",

      "b\"The Teletype could not move the head backwards, so it did not put a key on the keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead there was a key marked &quot;rubout&quot; that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a hand-typed paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |title=Re: editor and word processor history (was: Re: RTF for emacs) |author=Barry Margolin |mailing-list=help-gnu-emacs |date=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], so these systems had to use the available key and thus the DEL code to erase the previous character.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-6-monitor-manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |title=PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual |page=43 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-10-monitor-manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |title=PDP-10 Reference Handbook, Book 3, Communicating with the Monitor |page=5-5 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL code for the key marked &quot;Backspace&quot; while the key marked &quot;Delete&quot; sent an escape sequence, while many other terminals sent BS for the Backspace key. The Unix terminal driver could only use one code to back up, this could be set to BS ''or'' DEL, but not both, resulting in a very long period of annoyance where you had to correct it depending on what terminal you were using (modern shells using [[readline]] understand both codes). The assumption that no key sent a BS caused Control+H to be used for other purposes, such as a &quot;help&quot; command in Emacs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|title=Help - GNU Emacs Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\"\n",

      "b'Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The &quot;escape&quot; character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of &quot;escape&quot; encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called &quot;[[ANSI escape code]]&quot; (or, more properly, a &quot;[[Control Sequence Introducer]]&quot;) from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with ESC followed by a &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (system call)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.\\n'\n",
      "b'\\n'\n",
      "b'The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring &quot;plain text&quot; files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both &quot;Carriage Return&quot; (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and &quot;Line Feed&quot; (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name &quot;Carriage Return&quot; comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.\\n'\n",

      "b\"[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called &quot;glass TTYs&quot; (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When [[Gary Kildall]] created [[CP/M]] he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[RT-11]]. Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM's [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on [[CP/M]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|title=Is DOS a Rip-Off of CP/M?|author=[[Tim Paterson]]|date=August 8, 2007|website=DosMan Drivel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows]] inherited it from MS-DOS.\\n\"\n",

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the &quot;rubout&quot; code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo &quot;&lt;code&gt;^H&lt;/code&gt;&quot; for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{key press|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.}}\\n'\n",

Some computer languages used characters in 1961 ASCII such as up arrow and left arrow. These characters disappeared from 1968 ASCII. We worked with Fred Mocking, who by now was in Sales at [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]], on a type cylinder that would compromise the changing characters so that the meanings of 1961 ASCII were not totally lost. The underscore character was made rather wedge-shaped so it could also serve as a left arrow. }}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\"\n",
